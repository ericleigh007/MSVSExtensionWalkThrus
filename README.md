# MSVSExtensionWalkThrus
This repo contains the full source code for each of the Visual Studio Extensibility Examples.  Instead of having to go the docs and step through the examples, 
I thoought it may have been nice for Microsoft to include the code on github.

So here you go.

More samples will be added as time passes.

The first section is for [Editor Item Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/creating-an-extension-with-an-editor-item-template?view=vs-2019)
