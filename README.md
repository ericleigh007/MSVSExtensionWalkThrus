# MSVSExtensionWalkThrus
This repo contains the full source code for each of the Visual Studio Extensibility Examples.  Instead of having to go the docs and step through the examples, 
I thoought it may have been nice for Microsoft to include the code on github.

So here you go.

More samples will be added as time passes
