# Microsoft Visual Studio Extension Walk Throughs
This repo contains the full source code for each of the Visual Studio Extensibility Examples.  Instead of having to go the docs and step through the examples, just clone this repo and enjoy.

I thought it may have been nice for Microsoft to include the code on github, but they didn't. so I'm adding it.

These were produced using Visual Studio 2019 16.8.2 and greater.

More samples will be added as time passes.
